Hash function is used all across computer science. A hash function is simply that generates a value of fixed length
for each input it gets.

There are many types of Hash Generators like md5, SHA-1, SHA-256 etc.
MD5: for hello: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

Hash is one way. There is no way to decrypt from hash back to word. The only way is to get all the possible
hashes of each word and then find the exact hash match to get the word.

Hash for one word is going to be the same every time. Hash for hello will be same every time.

So, hash function is idempotent. It is a fancy way of saying a function given an input always gives the same output
for the same input. and we have no idea how to convert the output back to input.

Hash functions are really really fast. As the complexity of hash increases more time it takes.
