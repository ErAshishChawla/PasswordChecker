We are going to build a password checker. It is not some silly dumb password checker. It is the most secure way to check
if your password has ever been hacked

We are going to run the terminal and run PasswordChecker.py and input password. We will check if the password has ever
been hacked
run command: python PasswordChecker.py <pass1> <pass2>

The databases often get leaked and this data leak often contains emails, phonenumbers, passwords, addresses etc.
Hackers compile this list of emails and passwords, and try to login to different services. There is a website
created by Troy Hunt(a famous security researcher) and it is called https://haveibeenpwned.com/
We can search emails and check if the entered email has ever been pwned or has been a part of data breach.

We can also check the same for passwords. We enter a password and we can check if it has been breached or not.

Why do we care if email and passwords have been leaked?
Hackers use something called dictionary attack and dictionary attack is similar to the dictionary in python. Hacker
uses a massive dictionary which contains username and password. Hackers run this dictionary into different websites and
try to login to them using brute force attack. If your username and password is in this dictionary then it is risky
that they may login to your account.

This website is also not to be trusted. When we enter our password to be checked, it is sent through the internet and
someone might intercept it which is risky. There is a better way of doing this. This website also provides us an api
through which passwords can be checked in a secured way
